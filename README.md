# odin-recipes

This is The Odin Project's first project in the Foundations course, where I learned the following:
- The structure of html file.
- Some elements like h#, p, ul, ol, and the anchor tag to link differents file within the project.
- The use of Git, a version control system for managing code changes.
- The use of GitHub to manage it remotely and hosting the page.
